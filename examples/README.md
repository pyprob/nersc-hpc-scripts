# Example scripts

The scripts found here serve as an example of how to submit jobs on NERSC's
supercomputer [permutter](https://www.nersc.gov/systems/perlmutter/). While
meant for perlmutter (and GPU access), simply removing any GPU related settings
will also make these secripts usable with NERSC's
[cori](https://www.nersc.gov/systems/cori/).

As per NERSC's [documentation](https://docs.nersc.gov/development/shifter/),
these scripts make use of `shifter` which converts `Docker` images to a common
format which can be efficiently distributed.

The docker images used in this example is build using the Dockerfile found in
the Git repository
[mining-for-substructure-lens](https://github.com/pyprob/mining-for-substructure-lens/tree/pyprob_implementation).

A public docker container is available from
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mumunk/pyprob-mining), and can be directly
pulled by running

``` sh
shifterimg -v pull mmunk/pyprob-mining:latest
```

on NERSC's hpc.
